# Create Blog Page with Categorized Posts

## Overview
Replace the two separate blog links in the dropdown with a single "Blog" link that goes to a new blog.html page. The blog page will display blog posts categorized by their source platform (dev.to, Medium, etc.).

## Files to Create

1. **`blog.html`** - New blog page with categorized sections
   - Header with navigation (same as index.html)
   - Hero section with "Blog" title
   - Categorized sections for each platform (dev.to, Medium, etc.)
   - Each category displays blog posts with title, date, excerpt, and link
   - Footer (same as index.html)

2. **`blog.js`** - JavaScript for blog page
   - Load blog posts from data
   - Render posts by category
   - Handle navigation and interactions

## Files to Modify

1. **`index.html`** (line 55-56)
   - Replace two blog links with single "Blog" link
   - Change from:
     ```html
     <li><a href="https://dev.to/...">Blog (dev.to)</a></li>
     <li><a href="https://medium.com/...">Blog (Medium)</a></li>
     ```
   - To:
     ```html
     <li><a href="/blog">Blog</a></li>
     ```

2. **`data.js`** - Add blog posts data structure
   - Add `blogData` export with array of blog posts
   - Each post should have: title, url, platform (dev.to, Medium, etc.), date, excerpt
   - Example structure:
     ```javascript
     export const blogData = [
       {
         title: "Introduction to ARIMA: How I Gained Intuition Behind it",
         url: "https://dev.to/maha_data/how-i-gained-the-intuition-behind-the-arima-model-36a0",
         platform: "dev.to",
         date: "Mar 27, 2025",
         excerpt: "Exploring forecasting techniques with a focus on ARIMA..."
       },
       {
         title: "Your Programming Skills Aren't Disappearing...",
         url: "https://medium.com/@maha_dharsan/your-programming-skills-arent-disappearing-your-brain-is-just-being-efficient-e7f498aba52e",
         platform: "Medium",
         date: "Date here",
         excerpt: "Understanding how your brain works..."
       }
     ];
     ```

3. **`vite.config.js`** (line 8-10)
   - Add blog.html to rollupOptions.input
   - Add: `blog: resolve(__dirname, 'blog.html'),`

4. **`netlify.toml`** (line 11)
   - Add `/blog.html` to the except list
   - Update: `except = ["/success.html", "/blog.html", "/*.css", ...]`

5. **`styles.css`** - Add blog page styles
   - Styles for blog categories/sections
   - Blog post card styles
   - Platform badges/labels
   - Responsive design for blog layout

## Implementation Details

- Blog page will group posts by platform (dev.to, Medium, etc.)
- Each platform gets its own section with a heading
- Posts displayed as cards with title, date, excerpt, and "Read More" link
- External links open in new tab with proper security attributes
- Design matches existing portfolio style
- Fully responsive

## Result

- Single "Blog" link in Explore dropdown
- Clicking "Blog" navigates to `/blog` page
- Blog page displays posts organized by platform (dev.to, Medium, etc.)
- Easy to add new posts by updating `blogData` in `data.js`
